\section{\verb`Poly` Class}
\subsection{Defining a Polynomial}
A polynomial can be defined as a series of coefficients.  
\begin{align}
p(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + \ldots + c_n x^n
\end{align}
The \verb`Poly` class orders these coefficients into an array so that the index of each element is the same as the exponent of the term to which it corresponds (as below).
